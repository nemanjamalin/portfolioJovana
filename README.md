Project: Landing Page
Foundations Course - The Odin Project

Simple landing page project to test your flexbox foundations skills.

In this project I gave my best to replicate the assigment that odin project gave me.

Esentially I was given the design, with all necessary info (styles, fonts and etc).

But the whole developing process was to be done by myself.

By this point I had learned all I was required to know about css flexbox model of arranging blocks on the page.

Simply, I used my new learned skills and did my best to implement the landing page.

At first it was not easy, and it was overwhelming to be honest, but by deviding the project in smaller parts, I was able to finalize it.

Now the goal with this project was to prove that I can work with flexbox model.

This was an important task for me, as I could really see if I understand how flexbox really works, and I could also learn a lot from the plenty mistakes I made at fist.

By the end I understood how I have to deal with sections of the page, and the approach I must take to arrange objects on the page in the desired way.

Also I must say, taking this project made me realize how this layout model may behave in different conditions.

This was not just about learning flexbox for me, but also a general approach on the oraganization of objects on your page.
